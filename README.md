# DSS_Project_08-2020
As a project manager in the LSESU Data Science Society, I've planned this project with the aim of mentoring students who want to work on it, but are not necessarily experienced enough to do so on their own. 

The project involves sentiment analysis of tweets using deep learning techniques to inform a trading strategy. See Project brief.pdf and Sentiment Trading.ipynb for more information.
